The program is an implementation of the Graph Sparsification algorithm proposed in the attached paper.

Make sure that you have already installed in your system the Eigen library (https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).
In order to build the program just run make.

In order to run the program type in the command line %SpLap <X> <n>

, where X is the Laplacian matrix of the graph and n is the dimension of the Laplacian matrix.
