The program is an implementation of the Graph Sparsification algorithm proposed in the attached paper.

In order to build the program just call make.

In order to run the program type in the command line %SpLap <X> <n>

, where X is the Laplacian matrix of the graph and n is the dimension of the Laplacian matrix.
